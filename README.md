# Spin the Wheel

This is a simple Spin-the-Wheel game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Just a mini project I tried on HTML5

## Features

- Spin the wheel to get a random result.
- Customize the wheel with your own options.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PriyanshK09/Spin-the-Wheel-HTML.git
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

3. Click or tap the "Spin" button to spin the wheel.

## Customization

You can customize the wheel by modifying the `data labels` in `script.js`:

```javascript
data: {
    labels: ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F"],
```

## Credits

This project was inspired by [Wheel of Names](https://wheelofnames.com/).
